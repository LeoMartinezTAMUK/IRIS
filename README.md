## Introduction

Real-time network intrusion detection is essential for safeguarding modern digital infrastructures. However, accurately classifying malicious traffic remains a persistent challenge, especially with the heavily imbalanced datasets often used in model training. Traditional machine learning models frequently struggle with underrepresented attack classes.

**IRIS** proposes a novel approach leveraging a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for **dimensionality reduction**, improving feature representation and computational efficiency. Unlike conventional models that rely on handcrafted feature selection, our DNN learns to automatically capture critical patterns in high-dimensional data while reducing redundancy. This dimensionality reduction minimizes detection latency, making the system suitable for real-time deployment.

The proposed framework enhances downstream classifier performance and aims to deliver faster, more effective intrusion detection. Evaluation will use benchmark datasets with a focus on classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scoreâ€”offering a scalable and adaptive solution to modern cybersecurity threats.

### Dataset

The model uses the **UNSW-NB15** dataset, which includes 49 features and 9 attack types:
- Fuzzers
- Analysis
- Backdoors
- DoS
- Exploits
- Generic
- Reconnaissance
- Shellcode
- Worms

### Preprocessing

- **Standardization**: Applied to all numerical features to normalize scales.
- **Label Encoding**: Applied to categorical features to convert them into numerical values.

### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the model, we use:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**

Both class-wise and weighted metrics are computed to address the impact of class imbalance.
